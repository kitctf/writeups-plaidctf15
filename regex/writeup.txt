tl;dr We used a SAT formulation of the problem and used minisat to solve it.

Step 1: Introduce a variable for each position/character, meaning that the given
character is at that position of the final string. Conjecture that for each
position, one of the variables must be true (one clause per position).

Step 2: Introduce for every combination of position/character set a new variable
that means that none of the characters in the set is at that position. Add
implications to the negation of the corresponding position/character variables
from above.

For each alternative in the regex, add an OR clause of the up to three variables
from step 2 that describe the alternative.

Solve the resulting instance with minisat.
