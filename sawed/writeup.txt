we guessed that the wasd characters represent the corresponding key presses in
computer games, where they are often used for navigation. We wrote a simple script
that traced the 2-d positions of our "cursor" and played with different
interpretation of the interleaved e characters. We finally figured out that they
toggle a drawing mode where the positions of the cursor are filled with black.

The solve.py python script reconstructs and displays the resulting image.
