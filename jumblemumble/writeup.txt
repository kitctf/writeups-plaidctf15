jumble mumble was a slightly obfuscated binary, which used conditional jumps to the string "poop" to throw off static analysis.
In essence it took a hex-encoded string from argv[1] and split it into chunks of 4 DWORDS. In one round the dwords would be
mangled with each other and then they all together would be interpreted as a quadratic matrix. The matrix would then be
rotated counter-clockwise by 90 degrees, before the next round starts. In a total of 0x80 rounds, four different functions
were chosen depending upon the round number to mangle the sets of DWORDS (A, B, C, D). After 0x80 rounds, the result would
be strcmp'ed to the string "The flag is *not* poop [...]" and if they matched, the given input had to be submitted as flag.

The rotate and mangles are bijective and reversing the whole algorithm with the aforementioned string yielded indeed the flag.
